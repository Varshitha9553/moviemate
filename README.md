# 🎬 **MoviMate — Your Movie Matchmaker**

MoviMate is a **content-based movie recommendation system** that helps users discover movies similar to their interests using metadata-driven similarity analysis.  
It is designed to be **simple, fast, and intuitive**, focusing on meaningful recommendations rather than overwhelming users with options.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Search-based Recommendations**  
  Get movie suggestions similar to a selected movie using cosine similarity.

- 🌍 **Browse by Language**  
  Explore popular movies filtered by language.

- 🎲 **Surprise Me Mode**  
  Get randomly recommended movies when you don’t know what to watch.

- 🎭 **Genre Awareness**  
  Recommendations consider genres and descriptive metadata.

- 🖼️ **Poster Integration**  
  Movie posters are fetched dynamically using TMDB API.

---

## 🧠 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

1. Movie metadata is cleaned and processed.
2. Text features are converted into vectors.
3. **Cosine similarity** is used to find movies that are most alike.
4. Top similar movies are ranked and displayed to the user.

This is a **content-based filtering** approach — it does not rely on user ratings or history.
